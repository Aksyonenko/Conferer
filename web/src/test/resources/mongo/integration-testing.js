Bring your own JavaScript and we will start the test process together - from writing unit tests, to integration tests, all the way to running them manually and most importantly run them automatically as part of an automated process. Along the way we will investigate ideas for refactoring your code to make it more testable and give quick overviews about testable patterns and how they apply to your JavaScript.We will use the Jasmine as the unit test framework, Karma (nee Testacular) for automation, and Istanbul for code coverage as we construct a complete JavaScript testing solution. We will also touch upon WebDriver and how it fits into client-side JavaScript integration testing.

Based on the Mike Amundsen's multi-part InfoQ article series of the same name, this fast paced, hands-on four-hour workshop shows attendees how to design a hypermedia style API, how to implement a server that supports varying hypermedia responses, and how to build clients that can take advantage of hypermedia. Additional time will be spent exploring when clients break and how reliance on hypermedia can reduce the need for re-coding and re-deploying client applications while still supporting new features in the API. Hands-on labs include authoring a hypermedia format for your API, designing server-side components that can emit hypermedia responses, and deciding on which client-side style of hypermedia fits best for your needs. A final challenge will be to update the server-side responses with new features that do not break existing hypermedia clients.",

			"details"		: "QCon London is the seventh annual London enterprise software development conference designed for developers, team leads, architects and project management is back! There is no other event in the UK with similar opportunities for learning, networking, and tracking innovation occurring in the Java, .NET, Html5, Mobile , Agile, and Architecture communities. Key takeaway points and the many blog discussions from last year's QCon London can be found in this article. Our concept has always been to present the latest developments as they become relevant and interesting for the software development community. With a 360 degree perspective we present new technology and trends in a non vendor forum to give the attendees inspiration, energy and desire to learn. Plus, we always have awesome speakers! QCon London is organized by Trifork A/S, a software development company situated in Aarhus, Denmark and InfoQ - Tracking change and innovation in the enterprise software development community.",

Two examples of Android design patterns: plugging a 'listener' into a 'view' to make it touch-sensitive; and plugging an 'adapter' into an 'adapter view' to let it read items from a source of data.Hardware and software: Macs or PCs with the JDK (Java Development Kit), the application Eclipse (currently version 4.2 [Juno]), Android SDK and ADT.",

Together these APIs will allow you to be more productive by simplifying enterprise development. WebSocket attempts to solve the issues and limitations of HTTP for real-time communication. A new API is getting added to build WebSocket driven applications. Processing JSON structures is inherent in any HTML5 applications and a new API to parse, generate, transform, and query JSON is being added to the platform. JavaServer Faces will add support for HTML5 forms. There are several other improvements coming in this latest version of the platform. The Java EE 7 platform is scheduled to release in Q2 2013. Some of the implementations are already integrated in GlassFish. This talk will provide a code-intensive introduction to the updated Java EE 7 platform.
