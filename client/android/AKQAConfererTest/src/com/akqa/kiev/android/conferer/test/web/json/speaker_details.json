  "about" : "Toby O'Rourke is a Technical Architect at Gamesys, a London based soft-gaming company. With a background as a Java guy, he considers himself lucky to rove around the tech landscape at Gamesys combining architecture and hands on development with exposure to a fairly eclectic mix of client, server and native mobile technologies. He believes an excited team, plenty of domain modelling and a beady eye on the details are decent starting point for delivering just about anything.",
