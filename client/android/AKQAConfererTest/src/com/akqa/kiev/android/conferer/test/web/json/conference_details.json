A practitioner-driven conference, QCon is designed for technical team leads, architects, engineering directors, and project managers who influence innovation in their teams. QCon highlights the most important development topics driving innovation - things you should be doing now or researching for your next project - presented by the doers in our community. Our conferences bring practitioners together with attendees who influence innovation in their teams: over half of conferences attendees, for example, have team lead or higher job titles. Additionally, QCons are staged in an intimate environment that promotes high-quality learning, peer-sharing, fun, and inspiration! QCon starts with 2 days of tutorials on Monday and Tuesday, June 10-11 followed by the full 3-day conference from Wednesday, June 12-14. The conference will feature over 100 speakers in 6 concurrent tracks daily covering the most timely and innovative topics driving the evolution of enterprise software development today. The setting is the beautiful, centrally-located Marriott at Brooklyn Bridge in New York City.",

This is valuable, but not what this tutorial is about.",

Developers and security professionals have been struggling to fit this new technology into their existing models of the web. It's time to look at the fundamentals of WebSocket communication and web development, then use these to build a new way of understanding web development. In this session, we'll look deeply at the WebSocket protocol, see how to apply it to common design patterns (broadcast, request-response, and mediated peer-to-peer), then apply this knowledge to building HTML5 WebSocket clients. We'll also look at how to make this work on the desktop and mobile devices. We'll also cover the testing issues that arise when developing on multiple platforms and provide real-world strategies for efficient testing. You'll take home pointers to resources, roadmaps for learning the client-side technologies, and a copy of the finished application source code to jump-start your own development efforts.",
